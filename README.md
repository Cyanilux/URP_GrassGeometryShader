# URP_GrassGeometryShader
Example of a Grass Geometry Shader for Unity, Universal Render Pipeline. </br>
Based on https://github.com/IronWarrior/UnityGrassGeometryShader</br>
</br>

- For URP only
- Supports Main Light Lighting & Shadows (both receiving and casting)
- Grass blades sway slightly. WindStrength to adjust speed (but doesn't really look great at higher values)
- Some optional grass blade detail based on camera distance
- Includes tessellation (Uniform only)
